## DevStats

The Confidential Containers project is a collection of logically and
programatically bound sub-projects, hosted across multiple git repositories
under the Confidential Containers GitHub organization.

Below is a chart of all GitHub activities across all Confidential Containers
repositories, since it's acceptance as a CNCF project:
* [Confidential Containers GithHub Contributions per repository (2022-03-08 to Now)](https://confidentialcontainers.devstats.cncf.io/d/1/activity-repository-groups?orgId=1&from=1646694000000&to=1686261599000)

The following chart is an aggregating view of all contributions to the
Confidential Containers project as whole, for the same time period:
* [Confidential Containers GithHub Contributions (2022-03-08 to Now)](https://confidentialcontainers.devstats.cncf.io/d/74/contributions-chart?orgId=1&var-period=d7&var-metric=contributions&var-repogroup_name=All&var-country_name=All&var-company_name=All&var-company=all&from=1646694000000&to=now-1h)

The project hourly activity for the same period is shown in the below chart:

These charts and statistics show a few interesting points:

* Since its acceptance as a CNCF project, the project has seen a steady stream
  of contributions.
* A very important metric for Confidential Containers: More than 40 new
  contributors have joined the project over the past year.
* Contributions are spread over different repositories, showing the width of the
  project:
  * On the client side, the `enclave-cc`, `attestation-agent`, `td-shim` and
    `image-rs` projects take the bulk of the contributions.
  * On the attestation part of the project, most of the contributions went to
    the `kbs` and `attestation-service` repositories.
  * The `cloud-api-adaptor` and `operator` sub-projects merged most of the
    infrastructure related contributions to Confidential Containers.
